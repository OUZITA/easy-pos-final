# TLGold POS System Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the TLGold POS (Point of Sale) system on a new PC. The system is built using Laravel 11 with Filament for the admin panel.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following software is installed on your system: (for php and Mysql , use laragon for ease of use)

1. **PHP 8.1 or higher** (with extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, XML)

    - Download from: https://www.php.net/downloads
    - Add PHP to your system PATH

2. **Composer** (PHP dependency manager)

    - Download from: https://getcomposer.org/download/
    - Install globally

3. **Node.js 16 or higher** (with npm)

    - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
    - This is required for building frontend assets

4. **MySQL 8.0 or higher** (or MariaDB)

    - Download from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
    - Create a database user and database for the application

5. **Git** (for cloning the repository)
    - Download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PHP Extensions Missing**: Run `php -m` to check installed extensions. Install missing ones via your package manager or PHP installer.

2. **Database Connection Failed**: Verify your `.env` database credentials and ensure MySQL is running.

3. **Permission Denied**: On Windows, run your terminal as Administrator. On Linux/Mac, check file permissions.

4. **Port 8000 Already in Use**: Change the port with `php artisan serve --port=8080`

5. **Composer Memory Limit**: If composer install fails, increase memory limit: `php -d memory_limit=-1 /path/to/composer install`
